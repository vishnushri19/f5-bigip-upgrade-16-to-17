# F5 BIG-IP Automation Blueprints – Roadmap

This repository will grow beyond the 16 → 17 upgrade to include additional, production-focused blueprints:

- Onboarding with Declarative Onboarding (DO)
- Application delivery and WAF using AS3 and FAST
- Telemetry and observability using F5 Telemetry Streaming (TS)
- BIG-IP Next automation examples

The current focus is the 16 → 17 upgrade solution, which is considered **Solution 01** in this roadmap.
