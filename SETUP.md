# Get-ChildItem -Force

You should see:

text
.
├── .gitignore
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts.ini
├── group_vars/
│   └── bigip.yml
├── playbooks/
│   ├── pre_upgrade_checks.yml
│   ├── upgrade_bigip.yml
│   └── post_upgrade_checks.yml
├── README.md
├── SETUP.md
└── requirements.yml

✓ Cloning complete!

## Step 3: Install Ansible and F5 Collection

3.1 Create a Python virtual environment (recommended)
This isolates your project dependencies:

macOS/Linux:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Windows PowerShell:

powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
You should see (venv) appear in your terminal prompt.

3.2 Upgrade pip
bash
pip install --upgrade pip
3.3 Install Ansible
bash
pip install ansible
3.4 Verify Ansible installation
bash
ansible --version
You should see output like:

text
ansible [core 2.14.x] ...

3.5 Install F5 collection from requirements file
bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
Or install manually:

bash
ansible-galaxy collection install f5networks.f5_modules
3.6 Verify F5 collection installation
bash
ansible-galaxy collection list | grep f5
You should see:

text
f5networks.f5_modules    X.XX.X
✓ Ansible and F5 collection installed!

## Step 4: Configure Your Environment

4.1 Create a local credentials file (DO NOT commit to GitHub)
Create a new file: inventory/hosts_local.ini

bash
# On macOS/Linux
touch inventory/hosts_local.ini

# On Windows PowerShell
New-Item -Path "inventory/hosts_local.ini" -ItemType File
4.2 Edit inventory/hosts_local.ini with your F5 details
Open the file with your text editor and add:

# LOCAL F5 DEVICE CONFIGURATION
# ⚠️  WARNING: This file contains credentials
# ⚠️  DO NOT COMMIT TO GITHUB (already in .gitignore)

[bigip]
# Replace with your actual F5 device details
bigip01 ansible_host=YOUR_F5_IP_ADDRESS ansible_user=admin ansible_password=YOUR_F5_PASSWORD

[bigip:vars]
ansible_network_os=f5networks.f5_modules
ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=yes
ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=no
ansible_httpapi_port=443
ansible_connection=httpapi

Example with real values:

text
[bigip]
bigip01 ansible_host=192.168.1.100 ansible_user=admin ansible_password=MyF5SecurePass123!

[bigip:vars]
ansible_network_os=f5networks.f5_modules
ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=yes
ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=no
ansible_httpapi_port=443
ansible_connection=httpapi


4.3 Update group_vars/bigip.yml with your settings
Open group_vars/bigip.yml and update:


# IMPORTANT: Update these values based on your environment

# Target BIG-IP version
bigip_version_target: "17.1.1.3"

# Choose ONE image source option:

# OPTION 1: HTTP server (comment out if not using)
image_source_type: "http"
bigip_software_url: "http://your-internal-server/BIGIP-17.1.1.3.0.0.6.iso"

# OPTION 2: Already on F5 device (uncomment if using)
# image_source_type: "local_f5"
# bigip_software_local_path: "/var/tmp/BIGIP-17.1.1.3.0.0.6.iso"

# OPTION 3: On your local machine (uncomment if using)
# image_source_type: "local_control_node"
# bigip_software_local_path: "/Users/YourName/Downloads/BIGIP-17.1.1.3.0.0.6.iso"

# Target boot volume
bigip_target_volume: "HD1.2"

4.4 Verify file permissions
bash
# Check .gitignore to ensure local files won't be committed
cat .gitignore | grep hosts_local

# You should see it's listed to prevent accidental commits
✓ Configuration complete!

## Step 5: Test Connection to F5
5.1 Test basic connectivity
bash
# Test connection to your F5
ansible all -i inventory/hosts_local.ini -m ping
Expected output (Success):
text
bigip01 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Troubleshooting connection issues:
Error: "Host unreachable"
# 1. Verify F5 IP is correct
# 2. Check network connectivity
ping YOUR_F5_IP_ADDRESS

# 3. Verify port 443 is open
telnet YOUR_F5_IP_ADDRESS 443

Error: "Authentication failed"

bash
# 1. Verify username in hosts_local.ini (usually 'admin')
# 2. Verify password is correct
# 3. Check if user account is locked on F5

5.2 Get F5 system information
bash
# Retrieve F5 device info
ansible bigip01 -i inventory/hosts_local.ini -m bigip_device_info -a "gather_subset=system-info"

You should see your F5 device information including current version.

✓ Connection successful!


## Step 6: Run Pre-Upgrade Checks
6.1 Run the pre-upgrade validation playbook
bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/pre_upgrade_checks.yml -i inventory/hosts_local.ini

What it checks:
✓ Device connectivity

✓ Current version is 16.x

✓ Disk space available

✓ Boot volume status

✓ HA configuration

✓ Virtual servers/pools

✓ Creates configuration backup

✓ Creates UCS backup

✓ Verifies license

✓ Checks system health

✓ Verifies ISO accessibility

Expected output:
text
TASK [Display pre-upgrade check header] **
ok: [bigip01] => {
    "msg": "=== PRE-UPGRADE VALIDATION CHECKS ===\n..."
}

TASK [Verify current version is 16.x] **
ok: [bigip01]

...

TASK [Display pre-upgrade checklist summary] **
ok: [bigip01] => {
    "msg": "=== PRE-UPGRADE VALIDATION CHECKLIST - SUMMARY ===\n✓ Device Connectivity: PASSED\n..."
}

6.2 Review the pre-upgrade report
bash
# Find and view the generated report
ls -la /tmp/f5_pre_upgrade_report_*.txt

# View the report
cat /tmp/f5_pre_upgrade_report_*.txt
If any checks FAIL:
Read the error message carefully

Check the "Troubleshooting" section below

Fix the issue

Re-run the pre-checks

Do NOT proceed to upgrade until all checks PASS

✓ Pre-upgrade checks complete!

## Step 7: Perform Upgrade
⚠️ IMPORTANT BEFORE PROCEEDING:
✓ All pre-upgrade checks PASSED

✓ Backups were created successfully

✓ You scheduled a maintenance window

✓ You notified stakeholders

✓ You verified F5 has sufficient disk space

✓ You have network access to the F5 device

7.1 Run the upgrade playbook
bash
# Start the upgrade
ansible-playbook playbooks/upgrade_bigip.yml -i inventory/hosts_local.ini -v

The -v flag shows verbose output so you can monitor progress.

What the upgrade does:
Gets current F5 version (16.x)

Creates pre-upgrade backup

Uploads/accesses ISO image

Installs software on target volume

Reboots F5 device

Waits for device to come back online (2-5 minutes)

Verifies new version

ok: [bigip01] => {
    "msg": "Current version: 16.1.x"
}

TASK [Upload software image to BIG-IP] **
changed: [bigip01]

TASK [Reboot BIG-IP] **
changed: [bigip01]

TASK [Wait for device to come back online] **
ok: [bigip01]

TASK [Display new version] **
ok: [bigip01] => {
    "msg": "Upgrade complete! New version: 17.1.1.3"
}
7.2 Monitor the upgrade
During upgrade (2-5 minutes):

DO NOT close terminal or interrupt the process

DO NOT reboot F5 manually

DO NOT unplug network cables

Monitor the console output for progress

If upgrade FAILS:
Check error message

Log into F5 web console to check status

Review system logs: /var/log/ltm

See "Troubleshooting" section below

✓ Upgrade complete!

## Step 8: Run Post-Upgrade Checks

8.1 Run the post-upgrade validation playbook
bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/post_upgrade_checks.yml -i inventory/hosts_local.ini
What it verifies:
✓ Device is online and responsive

✓ New version is correct (17.x)

✓ Boot volume is correct

✓ License is valid

✓ Virtual servers are online

✓ Pools and members are healthy

✓ HA status (if applicable)

✓ System health

✓ Network interfaces

✓ System logs clean

✓ DNS resolution working

✓ NTP sync correct

✓ Backups accessible

Expected output:
text
TASK [Verify upgraded version] **
ok: [bigip01]

TASK [Display new version] **
ok: [bigip01] => {
    "msg": "New BIG-IP version: 17.1.1.3"
}

TASK [Display post-upgrade validation summary] **
ok: [bigip01] => {
    "msg": "=== POST-UPGRADE VALIDATION CHECKLIST - SUMMARY ===\n✓ Device Connectivity: PASSED\n✓ Version Verification: PASSED (17.1.1.3)\n..."
}
8.2 Review the post-upgrade report
bash
# Find and view the generated report
ls -la /tmp/f5_post_upgrade_report_*.txt

# View the report
cat /tmp/f5_post_upgrade_report_*.txt
8.3 Post-upgrade next steps:
✓ Verify application traffic is flowing correctly

✓ Test failover if HA is configured

✓ Monitor device for 24 hours

✓ Review backup files

✓ Document upgrade completion

✓ Notify stakeholders

✓ Upgrade process complete!
