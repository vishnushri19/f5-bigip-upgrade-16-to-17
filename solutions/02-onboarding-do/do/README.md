# DO Declarations

This folder will contain Declarative Onboarding (DO) JSON declarations used to onboard BIG-IP devices.

Planned examples:

- `single-device-basic.json` – single BIG-IP with basic system and network settings
- `ha-pair-basic.json` – active/standby BIG-IP pair with shared VLANs, Self IPs, and device group/HA configuration
- `ha-pair-l3.json` – HA across subnets with floating Self IPs and routes (future)
